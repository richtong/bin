# Infrastructure Binary Utility commands

These are (mainly by @richtong) convenience programs for use in installing and
managing the dev environment. They are mainly experimental and are called from here.
There are a few which are used and these are connected to local-bin. See
local-bin/README.md for how to do that

Most of time if you need to install something just try grepping for the right
shell file.

For complete documentation, see the Mkdocs site at
[Documentation](https://bin.docs.tongfamily.com) or look on GitHub look see the
[docs directory](https://github.com/richtong/bin/docs).
